# üêò The Guide to `Parent child = new Child();`

The statement `Parent child = new Child();` is one of the most powerful and fundamental patterns in object-oriented programming (OOP), especially in Java.

## 1\. What's Happening?

  * **Reference Type (`Parent`):** This is the **type of the variable**. It tells the compiler what methods and fields you are *allowed* to call (the contract).
  * **Object Type (`Child()`):** This is the **actual object** created in memory. It determines *which* version of an overridden method will run at execution time (the implementation).

The code works because the **`Child`** class is a subclass of **`Parent`**, meaning a `Child` *is-a* `Parent`.

## 2\. Why Do That? (The Core Benefit: Polymorphism)

The main reason is to leverage **Polymorphism** (Greek for "many forms").

| Concept | Explanation | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flexibility** | Your code is written against the **general** type (`Animal`), not the **specific** type (`Dog`). | If you later create a `Cat` or `Bird`, your existing code (like methods or collections) doesn't need to change. |
| **Decoupling** | The code that uses the object is **decoupled** from the object's precise implementation. | It makes your system easier to maintain, extend, and test. Changing how a `Dog` works won't break the code that just expects an `Animal`. |
| **Method Overriding** | At runtime, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) calls the specific, **overridden** method in the actual `Child` object. | `Animal dog = new Dog(); dog.makeSound();` calls the `Dog`'s specific *Woof\!*, not the generic *Growl*. |

## 3\. When to Use It (Key Scenarios)

### A. Working with Collections/Lists

This is the most common and compelling reason.

**Scenario:** You have a list of different object types that share a common parent.

```java
// You can't put Dogs, Cats, and Birds in a List<Dog>
List<Animal> zoo = new ArrayList<>();
zoo.add(new Dog()); 
zoo.add(new Cat()); 
zoo.add(new Bird());

// You can iterate over them and treat them all as Animals.
for (Animal a : zoo) {
    a.makeSound(); // JVM calls the specific sound for each object!
}
```

### B. Method Parameters

**Scenario:** A method needs to operate on *any* object that shares a common contract.

```java
// This method can accept any Animal object: Dog, Cat, Horse, etc.
public void vetCheckup(Animal creature) { 
    creature.eat(); // Calls the specific eat() method
    creature.makeSound(); 
}

vetCheckup(new Dog()); // Pass a Dog
vetCheckup(new Cat()); // Pass a Cat
```

### C. Interfacing with Frameworks

**Scenario:** Using frameworks or libraries, especially when working with **Interfaces** (a special kind of Parent).

```java
// Example: Using the List Interface
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>(); 
// 'List' is the reference (the contract/parent), 'ArrayList' is the implementation (the child).
```

-----

## 4\. When **NOT** to Use It

Don't use the parent reference if you need to access methods or fields that exist **only** in the child class.

### The Limitation

The **Reference Type** (`Parent`) determines what you can call. If the `Dog` class has a unique method called `fetch()`, you **cannot** call it when the reference is `Animal`.

```java
Animal dog = new Dog(); 
dog.makeSound(); // OK (Animal has makeSound)
dog.fetch();     // ‚ùå COMPILE ERROR! Animal doesn't have a fetch() method.

// To call the unique child method, you must use the child reference:
Dog realDog = new Dog();
realDog.fetch(); // ‚úÖ OK
```

### The Fix (Casting)

If you have an `Animal` reference and you know *for sure* it's a `Dog`, you can cast it back to the child type to access the unique methods.

```java
Animal animalReference = new Dog();

// Check the type before casting to avoid a runtime error!
if (animalReference instanceof Dog) {
    Dog dogReference = (Dog) animalReference; // Casting
    dogReference.fetch(); // ‚úÖ Now you can call the unique method
}
```

# Interface Polymorphism
This also works with interfaces, for example you have an interface `Drivable` and you have classes: `ElectricCar`, `GasCar`, `RobotCar`

You can have something like this

```java
Drivable d = new ElectricCar();
```
Why do that, to make it flexible

1. If you use

   ```java
   ElectricCar myCar = new ElectricCar();
   ```

   ‚Äî you‚Äôre tied to that *specific class*.

2. But if you use

   ```java
   Drivable d = new ElectricCar();
   ```

   ‚Äî your code only depends on the *ability to drive*, not on what kind of vehicle it is.

That means later, you could easily switch to

```java
d = new RobotCar();
```

or

```java
d = new GasCar();
```

‚Äî without changing anything else, as long as they all implement `Drivable`.

So:
**Interfaces let you write flexible, modular code that doesn‚Äôt care about the exact class ‚Äî only about what it can do.**

A sample program for it is:
```java
Drivable d;
if (choice.equals("electric")) {
    d = new ElectricCar();
} else if (choice.equals("gas")) {
    d = new GasCar();
} else {
    d = new RobotCar();
}
d.start(); // works for all of them!
```
Perfect üëå ‚Äî let‚Äôs look at this short example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

interface Drivable {
    void start();
    void stop();
}

class ElectricCar implements Drivable {
    public void start() { System.out.println("ElectricCar starting silently..."); }
    public void stop() { System.out.println("ElectricCar stopping."); }
}

class GasCar implements Drivable {
    public void start() { System.out.println("GasCar roaring to life!"); }
    public void stop() { System.out.println("GasCar shutting down."); }
}

class RobotCar implements Drivable {
    public void start() { System.out.println("RobotCar activating systems..."); }
    public void stop() { System.out.println("RobotCar powering off."); }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Drivable> vehicles = new ArrayList<>();

        vehicles.add(new ElectricCar());
        vehicles.add(new GasCar());
        vehicles.add(new RobotCar());

        for (Drivable v : vehicles) {
            v.start();
            v.stop();
            System.out.println("---");
        }
    }
}
```

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on:

* The `ArrayList<Drivable>` can hold *any object* that implements the `Drivable` interface.
* Even though each object is a different *type*, the loop just calls `start()` and `stop()` ‚Äî and Java automatically runs the **correct version** for each class.

This is interface-based **polymorphism** in action.
