# Instance Data vs Class Data in Python OOP

## 1. Class Data (Class Attributes)

* Belong to the class itself, not to individual objects.
* Shared by all instances of the class.
* Defined directly inside the class body, outside of methods.
* Useful for constants or data common to all objects of that class.

**Example:**

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"  # class attribute

dog1 = Dog()
dog2 = Dog()

print(dog1.species)  # Canis familiaris
print(dog2.species)  # Canis familiaris

# reassign class attribute through the class
Dog.species = "Canis lupus familiaris"

print(dog1.species)  # Canis lupus familiaris
print(dog2.species)  # Canis lupus familiaris
```

---

## 2. Instance Data (Instance Attributes)

* Belong to a specific object created from the class.
* Each instance has its own copy.
* Usually defined inside the `__init__` method using `self`.

**Example:**

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name   # instance attribute
        self.age = age     # instance attribute

dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Milo", 5)

print(dog1.name)  # Buddy
print(dog2.name)  # Milo

# reassign instance attribute only affects that object
dog1.age = 4
print(dog1.age)  # 4
print(dog2.age)  # 5
```

---

## 3. Reassignment Rules

### 3.1 Reassigning Class Attributes

* If reassigned through the class, all instances see the change.
* If reassigned through an object, **that object gets a new instance attribute with the same name**, shadowing the class attribute.

**Example:**

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"  # class attribute

dog1 = Dog()
dog2 = Dog()

# reassign via the class
Dog.species = "New Species"
print(dog1.species)  # New Species
print(dog2.species)  # New Species

# reassign via an instance
dog1.species = "Instance-specific species"
print(dog1.species)  # Instance-specific species
print(dog2.species)  # New Species
print(Dog.species)   # New Species
```

Explanation:

* `dog1.species = "Instance-specific species"` created a new **instance attribute** named `species` for `dog1`.
* It did not change the class attribute, nor affect other instances.

---

### 3.2 Reassigning Instance Attributes

* Only affects that object.
* Does not affect other instances or the class.

**Example:**

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

dog1 = Dog("Buddy")
dog2 = Dog("Milo")

dog1.name = "Max"
print(dog1.name)  # Max
print(dog2.name)  # Milo
```

## 4. Key Differences

| Feature              | Class Data (Attributes)                                  | Instance Data (Attributes)            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Belongs to           | The class itself                                         | Individual objects (instances)        |
| Shared?              | Yes, across all instances                                | No, unique to each instance           |
| Defined in           | Class body                                               | Usually inside `__init__`             |
| Modified via         | Class name (affects all instances)                       | Object reference (affects one object) |
| Reassignment via obj | Creates/shadows instance attribute, doesn’t change class | Affects only that instance            |

## 5. Attribute Lookup Order

When you access an attribute using `object.attribute`, Python looks for it in this order:

1. **Instance namespace** (the object’s own attributes).

   * If the instance has that attribute, Python uses it.
   * This is why reassigning via the instance can shadow a class attribute.

2. **Class namespace** (the class attributes).

   * If the attribute is not found in the instance, Python checks the class.

3. **Parent classes (Method Resolution Order - MRO)**

   * If not found in the class, Python continues up the inheritance chain.

4. **Error**

   * If not found anywhere, Python raises an `AttributeError`.

### Diagram: Attribute Lookup

```
object.attribute  ──► instance attributes (object.__dict__)
                      │
                      ▼
                  class attributes (Class.__dict__)
                      │
                      ▼
             parent classes (following MRO)
                      │
                      ▼
                AttributeError (if not found)
```

### Example: Lookup in Action

```python
class Animal:
    species = "Unknown"

class Dog(Animal):
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

dog1 = Dog("Buddy")

# 1. Found in instance
dog1.name = "Max"
print(dog1.name)  # Max

# 2. Not found in instance, found in class
print(dog1.species)  # Canis familiaris

# 3. If not in Dog, would check Animal
del Dog.species
print(dog1.species)  # Unknown (from Animal)

# 4. Not found anywhere
print(dog1.age)  # AttributeError
```

---

## 6. Summary

* Instance attributes are stored per object.
* Class attributes are shared unless shadowed by an instance.
* Reassigning on the class changes the attribute for all instances.
* Reassigning on the instance only changes that one object.
* Python’s attribute lookup checks instance → class → parents → error.
